# Ignitech Å kolica

## Project Overview

This project is a web application developed using Angular for the frontend and ASP.NET Core for the backend. It provides various functionalities related to teachers, students, subjects, and grades.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js and npm.
- You have .NET SDK installed.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/Hpavic/IgnitechSkolica.git)>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```sh
    cd <repository-folder>/IgnitechSkolicaFrontend
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start both the backend and frontend servers. The frontend server will be available at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and the backend server at [http://localhost:5090/swagger](http://localhost:5090/swagger).

## Usage

Once both backend and frontend servers are running, you can interact with the application through the web interface.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend:** Contains the ASP.NET Core API which provides endpoints for teachers, students, subjects, and grades.
- **Frontend:** Contains the Angular application which interacts with the backend API and provides a user interface.
